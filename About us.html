				<span style="color: rgb(1, 5, 128); font-size: 3ex";>&#160;<strong>1. THE BIBLE&#160; </strong></span>
<div> We believe that :<br>
▪      The Bible is the Word of God, complete;<br>
▪      The sixty-six (66) books, as originally written, including the Old and New Testaments, were verbally inspired by the Spirit of God and are entirely error-free;<br>
▪      The Bible is the ultimate authority in all matters of faith and practice and is the true basis of Christian unity.<br>

.<br></div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128); font-size: 3ex";"><strong>  2. GOD&#160;</strong></span></div>
<div>   We believe in a God who is the creator and source of all things, holy, sovereign, eternal, existing and manifesting himself in three equal persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.   &#160;</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128); font-size: 3ex";"><strong>  3. JESUS CHRIST&#160;</strong></span></div>
<div>We believe in the absolute deity of Jesus Christ in his very being, in his eternal existence with the Father before his incarnation, in his miraculous birth of a virgin, his life without sin, his atoning death, his bodily resurrection, his ascension triumphal, his mediator's ministry and his personal return.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128); font-size: 3ex";"><strong>  4. THE HOLY SPIRIT &#160;</strong></span></div>
<div> We believe that the Holy Spirit is an absolutely divine person in his very being and that he convicts of sin, of justice and of judgment; He regenerates, sanctifies, illuminates, leads and comforts those who believe in Jesus Christ. </div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128); font-size: 3ex";"><strong>  5. SATAN&#160;</strong></span></div>
<div>We believe that Satan is an evil spirit existing as a bad personality, that he is at the origin of sin, the supreme enemy of God and man.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128); font-size: 3ex";">  6. THE MAN </span></strong></div>
<div>We believe that the human being was divinely created in the image of God to live in communion with Him, that he sinned becoming guilty before God, hence his total depravity by which he incurs physical and spiritual death. </div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128); font-size: 3ex"."><strong>  7. THE SALVATION&#160;</strong></span></div>
<div>We believe that human rebellion against God broke this communion and brought sin, death and destruction to the world. God has shown that he did not give up his creation by sending his only son Jesus to the earth to save it.
We believe that salvation comes from the grace of God, sovereign and elective; that by the decree of the Father Christ willingly suffered an expiatory and propitiatory death in our place; that justification is by faith alone in the all-sufficient sacrifice and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that those whom God has actually called will be divinely guarded and finally made perfect in the image of the Lord.
We believe that salvation is good news called the gospel because it allows forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God and eternal life.

<div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128); font-size: 3ex"."><strong>  8. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHURCH &#160;</strong></span></div>
<div>▪      It is based on Holy Scripture and not on tradition;<BR>
▪      It is the "temple of God", called to be holy;<br>
▪      She is the "body of Christ", of which He is the head;<br>
▪      She is the "pillar and support of the truth";<br>
▪      It is God's permanent spiritual army to fight against Satan by proclaiming the Gospel.<br>
